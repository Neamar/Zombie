Zombie

Old school Zombie game, just shoot them all.

Trying to use some interesting features, mainly keeping hundreds of zombies on the move while maintaining decent 30FPS (AS3 does not make it easy).

Use advanced masking to draw in the dark.
Use some interesting IA methods to keep everything fast (namely, tweaked potential fields / influence maps)

**Still a work in progress for now. Looking for a graphist and a sound designer**.
